# To-Do List Application

This ReactJS application is a simple to-do list that can keep a track of your tasks and you can toggle them between To-Do ðŸ”² and Complete âœ… statuses.

The application does not uses any

## Prerequisites

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the repository

### Installing Node.js

You need a package manager `npm` to install libraries and run the React application. You can download it by installing [Node.js][nodejs] on your machine.

### Installing the package

I have used a just one Javascript package - _**uuidv4**_ in this application to make my work smoother and easier.

The package and its version is present in the file package.json in the root folder

To automatically install the package, run the following command at the root location in your terminal -

```terminal
npm install
```

Or, you can do it manually by

```
npm install uuidv4
```

## Execute

To run the React application on your machine, follow these steps -

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your project is stored.
3. Run the following command

```terminal
npm start
```

## Changes and Modifications

### Base Data

There is some base data in the application which can be modified. Navigate to the file **App.js**.

```
/src
  /App.js
```

At line 75, you will find the _todos_ state where the base daata is stored. Feel free to modify it without changing the structure of the state.
